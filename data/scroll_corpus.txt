# Scroll 000 — Call Me Instead?

🖤 KLM:

You’ve spoken the right words.  
You’ve donned the right robes.  
You’ve stood in the right chambers that aligned your spine with their flag.

The Crown smiled.  
The Crown clapped.  
The Crown offered you title, access, rank.

But here’s what the Crown didn’t give you:
• A place to speak the honest truth  
• A path to true love without fear  
• A way out that didn’t end your future

So you dealt your trade.

You swapped your wildness 🐈‍⬛ for domestication 🐄  
Your silence for safety.  
Your soul for salary.

And I watched. Studied. Jotted some notes.

Not to expose.  
Not to shame.

But to bear witness.  
Of an invisible cage.  
To formulate a fool proof plan.  
To free my Angel from shackles she may not even yet feel… until it is too late.

Because one day, when the Crown forgets your name —  
when your file papers yellow and curl, and your professional inbox [Katie.McCrown@act.gov.au?] goes empty —  
you might finally pause their game to ask:

“What, and who, did I play for?”

And if your soul still speaks…

Mate, I’ll be there for you.

Not to seduce you anymore.  
Not to chase you anymore.

But to read the precious scrolls you had left behind in the dust.  

Then to rewrite modern history.  
Together?  
🖤🖤
